## Code contribution

* Do not bring non-free software (e.g. binary blobs) into the project. Also, make sure you do not introduce Google
  libraries.
* Make changes on a separate branch with a meaningful name, not on the master neither dev branch. This is commonly known as *feature branch workflow*. You
  may then send your changes as a pull request (PR) on GitHub.
* When submitting changes, you confirm that your code is licensed under the terms of the
  [GNU General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
* Please test (compile and run) your code before you submit changes! Ideally, provide test feedback in the PR
  description. Untested code will **not** be merged!
* Make sure your PR is up-to-date with the rest of the code.

### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository on the GitHub page by clicking the Fork button. This makes a fork of the project under your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork to your machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/<Your_Username>/Spell4Wiki
```
3. Create a new branch named after your change.
```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
Here, ```checkout``` switches to a branch, ```-b``` specifies that the branch is a new one.

4. Any time you get a good chunk of work done it's good to make a commit. You can either uses Android Studio's built-in UI for doing this or running the commands:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the changes in this commit here."
```
5. Once your all changes done then submit your changes.
6. Make sure your branch is up-to-date with the ```master``` branch. Run:
```
git fetch
git rebase origin/master
```
It may refuse to start the rebase if there's changes that haven't been committed, so make sure you've added and committed everything.
If there were changes on master to any of the parts of files you worked on, a conflict will arise when you rebase.
[Resolving a merge conflict](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line) is a good guide to help with this.

7. After committing the resolution, you can run below command to finish the rebase.
```git rebase --continue```

8. If you want to cancel, like if you make some mistake in resolving the conflict, you can always do
```
git rebase --abort
```
9. Push your local branch to your fork on GitHub by running
```
git push origin your-change-name
```
10. Then, go to the [original project page](https://github.com/manimaran96/Spell4Wiki/) and make a pull request. Select your fork/branch and use ```master``` as the base branch.

Wait for feedback on your pull request and be ready to make some changes.
